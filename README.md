This repository stores the raw data and simulation configuration files used in the experiments of the article entitled: 'Adaptive Impairment-aware Traffic Grooming in Elastic Optical Networks'.

You can rerun simulations for replication of experiments with the SNetS tool (snets-1.0-OPH.jar). More information on running the simulations can be found at https://github.com/iallengabio/SNetS.
